This project is about the creation of a GUI interface for the georeferencing of LSA-SAF and GEOLAND-2 BioPar HDF5 files.

Currently the project is working with LSA-SAF files. It is being tested on Ubuntu Linux and Windows XP.

There are 3 main files:

- h5georef.py - A module with the core functionality to georeference the HDF5 files.
- georef_hdf5.py - A script for command line usage.
- HDF5Georeferencer.py - A Graphical User Interface made with PyQt4.

------------
Dependencies
------------

This project uses:
    - python
    - gdal utility programs (gdal_translate and gdalwarp)
    - proj's cs2cs
    - The pytables python library
    - The graphical user interface is built with PyQt4

Installation

Installation on Ubuntu
----------------------

(I believe these instructions should work on another debian-based distributions as well and also no debian-based, with some adjustments):

    1 - Install dependencies. Open up a terminal and type:

    sudo apt-get install python-tables python-qt4 proj-bin gdal-bin

    2 - Download this repository. Press the 'Download this repository as ZIP file' button on github's project page. Extract the files.

Installation on Windows:
-----------------------

    1 - Download and install the FWTools package from:

	http://fwtools.maptools.org/

    2 - Download and install the python(x,y) distribution from

	 http://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/

        - When installing python(x,y) make sure you have AT LEAST the following packages selected:
            - PyQT
            - numexpr
            - pytables

    3 - Download this repository. Press the 'Download this repository as ZIP file' button on github's project page. Extract the files.

-----------------
Using the project
-----------------

Linux
-----

    1 - Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the code and double click on the HDF5Georeferencer.py file. 
        Choose to execute it if asked.

    2 - A graphical window will appear and the rest is (hopefully) self-explanatory.

Windows
-------
    1 - Start an FWTools shell (accessible from windows start menu).
    2 - Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the code. For example:
            
            cd "C:\Documents and Settings\ricardo\dev\LSASAF-georeferencer"

    3 - Execute the HDF5Georeferencer.py file with the python executable installed by python(x,y)

            C:\Python27\python.exe HDF5Georeferencer.py

    4 - A graphical window will appear and the rest is (hopefully) self-explanatory.
        
    TIP: press the <tab> key to get autocompletion from the command line, so you don't have to hardtype all the paths.


Using the tool through the command line and in scripts.
-------------------------------------------------------

The georef_hdf5.py script can be called from the command-line in order to use this tool in scripts. See the help for more details. It is available by running:

    georef_hdf5.py -h
